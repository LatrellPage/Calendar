# Daily Planner

## Description
The daily planner is a scheduling application that allows users to create a schedule for their day. When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. The application presents timeblocks for standard business hours, and each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

Users can click on a timeblock to enter an event and save it by clicking the "save" button. The text for that event is saved in local storage, and the saved events persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Installation
This is a web-based application that can be accessed via a web browser. Simply open the application's URL in your preferred web browser to start using it.
